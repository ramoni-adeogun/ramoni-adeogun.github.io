  <p>
    I am an  <a href= "https://vbn.aau.dk/da/persons/ramoni-ojekunle-adeogun" target="_blank"> Assistant Professor in Machine Learning for Beyond 5G Communications</a> with the <a href="https://www.es.aau.dk/sections-labs/Wireless-Communication-Networks/" target="_blank">Wireless Communication Networks</a>  section of the <a href="https://www.es.aau.dk/" target="_blank">Department of Electronic Systems </a> of <a href="https://www.en.aau.dk" target="_blank">Aalborg University, Denmark</a>.
  My research interests lie in the areas of Bayesian and statistical signal processing, machine learning, Artifical Inteligence and their application to radio resource management, interference coordination, channel prediction and modelling.
  </p>
<p>
 Between 2017 and 2021, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the same department where I worked on multi-link radio channel modelling using propagation graphs and later on radio design for B5G Wireless Isochronous Real Time (WIRT) systems.
</p>
<p>
   Since January 2020, I have also been working in tight collaboration with Nokia Bell Labs Aalborg as an External Research Engineer majorly on a project on design of 6G wireless interface using artificial inteligence. 
</p>
  <p>
   I received the B.Eng. degree (with first-class honors) in Electrical and Computer engineering from the Federal University of Technology Minna, Minna, Nigeria, in 2007 and a Ph.D. degree in Electronics and Computer Systems Engineering (with specialization in Communication and Signal Processing) from Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand in 2015. 
  </p>
  <p>
Between 2008 and 2009, I was with the Information and Communication Technology Directorate, University of Jos, Jos, Nigeria. In 2009, I worked briefly as a Telecommunications Engineer with Odua Telecoms Ltd., Ibadan, Nigeria. Between 2010 and 2016, I worked with Engineering and Space Science (ESS) Division of the  National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA), Abuja, Nigeria as a Principal Engineer. I also held a one-year postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Cape Town in 2016.

  </p>
  <p>
    I serve as a reviewer for IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, IEEE Signal Processing Letters, EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, and other international journals and conferences. I have served as Technical Programme Committee (TPC) member for several international conferences. I am a senior member of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and a member of International Association of Engineers (IAENG) and a registered engineer with the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN).
